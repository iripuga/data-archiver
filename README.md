## A python code for archiving anonymous data

A simple code I wrote for myself to help me have better control and anonymize users data.

### How to use code
1. change path to where you keep this code in files: lock.py, registration.py
2. run keygen.py code to generate encryption key
3. now run registration.py
4. enter some personal data into PyQt5 form which can be modified if needed
5. run lock.py and press e in the terminal
6. data in OsebniPodatki.xslx are now anonymously saved, table KodirnaTabela.xlsx encrypted and folder #person_id was created

As an example I ran the code once so you can see what it does by peeking into .xlsx files

If you really want to keep the data in OsebniPodatki.xlsx protected then it is best to keep file key.key somewhere else.
